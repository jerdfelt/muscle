Adding a new column
-------------------
This is mostly a problem for the SQL storage engine. No data needs to be
migrated from other columns/tables.

Renaming a column
-----------------
A new column should be added during the expand phase. Data should be
slowly migrated to the new column during reads. The old column should
be dropped during the contract phase.

Altering column schema
----------------------
In some cases, this can be done without any extra work from the
application. For instance, if changing from a VARCHAR(26) to VARCHAR(255),
then the application will liekly not need any extra logic to deal with
that.

For other changes, treat like 'Renaming a column' to ensure that the
data is semantically moved over.
